	   Perhaps you are wondering what object diagrams are!
		 <br/><br/>	 
		 Booch, Rumbaugh, and Jacobson describe object diagrams as diagrams that model the instances of 
		 things contained in class diagrams (we will explain class diagrams later). An object diagram 
     shows a set of objects and their relationships at a point in time.
     <br/><br/>
		 You use object diagrams to model the static design view or static process view of a system. 
		 This involves modeling a snapshot of the system at a moment in time and rendering a set of 
		 objects, their state, and their relationships.
		 <br/><br/>
		 Object diagrams are not only important for visualizing, specifying, and documenting structural 
		 models, but also for constructing the static aspects of systems through forward and 
		 reverse engineering.
