		 Hi! Welcome! 
		 <br/><br/>
		 This is the first time you are using this app. So, we won't give a challenge that will overwhelm you. 
     <br/><br/>
     Instead, we want you to model a simple &quot;Greeting&quot; application, an application that will say Hello to someone according to the name entered into a textbox. 
     <br/><br/>
     Thus, when a user click a button, it will show &quot;Hi, Sarah!&quot; or &quot;Hi, John!&quot;, as simple as that. 
     <br/><br/>
     The user can reset the greetings as well just by clicking a &quot;clear&quot; button. 
     <br/><br/>
     It's a simple a application, not a real-world application, but it's enough to introduce how to use this app and you
     will learn to model using object diagram.
		 <br/><br/>
		 So, what are you waiting for? Just click the blinking text below to start playing ...
